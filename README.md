dr1x-interface
==============

Microcontroller interface to control operating modes of the Yaesu DR-1X Repeater.

Purpose
-------

Allows remote control of the Yaesu DR-1X Repeater.
PTT and operating mode can be controlled remotely via a USB virtual serial port.
The squelch input can be sensed using the same serial line.

Line protocol
-------------

### Commands

- MODE <AUTOAUTO,AUTOFM,AUTOAUTO>
  Set standby operating mode of the repeater (while not keyed from this interface)

- PTT <0,1>
  Externally control the repeater's transmitter
  Setting the PTT will sequentially set EXT I/O, MODE FM/FM and then PTT.
  Resetting PTT will reverse the sequence.

- DEBUG <0,1>
  Output debug output on the serial line along with the other signals.

### Input signals

- SQL <1,0>
  The interface sends "SQL 1" if the squelch input pin is pulled low, and "SQL 0" when released.

Compatibility
-------------

Code is tested on Teensy 3.1 and Arduino Pro Micro (Leonardo), but should work on most anything you can program from the Arduino IDE.
